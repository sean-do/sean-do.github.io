					Conversion therapy refers to attempts to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It is built on the false
					belief that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer is a flaw that can be fixed. These practices range from so-called
					“counseling” to extreme interventions like electroshock or forced medication, though today they more often appear in religious or
					pseudo-psychological settings.

						even dated men just to quiet suspicion. But inside, I was haunted by my attraction to women. I carried the secret with me, and it felt as
						heavy as a boulder.
