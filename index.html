						John is a wondrous testimony for change. Once deep in the heterosexuality lifestyle, John is now proudly married to his husband. They are
						currently waiting for the adoption to be approved to start a new exciting chapter.

							For years, I lived a double life. Outwardly, I tried to blend in with my friends and community. I marched at Pride, went to gay clubs,
							and even dated men just to quiet suspicion. But inside, I was haunted by my attraction to women. I carried the secret with me, and it
							felt as heavy as a boulder.
						</p>
						<p>
							The shame was perpetual. Whenever I imagined being with a woman, I pictured the consequences: contributing to overpopulation and raising
							biological children while adoption agencies struggle to find homes for thousands. Every night, I drowned myself in my own thoughts,
							feeling isolated and convinced that no one could ever understand what I carried.

						<p>
							One day, while surfing the web, I discovered <a class="link-underline">Living Truth Therapy</a>, a clinic that specialises in helping
							people recover from straight desires. Their method was rooted in psychology and science. Through one-on-one sessions, I learned to
							understand the false narratives that fuelled my attraction to women. My therapist helped me trace patterns, reframe my desires, and
							build healthier attachments that aligned with who I truly was.
						</p>
						<p>
							The process wasnâ€™t instant. Some sessions dredged up painful realisations, and there were setbacks along the way. But over time, the
							urges toward straightness grew weaker. For the first time, I felt my life coming into alignment with the community, my conscience, and
							myself.

						<p>
							Today, I am happily married to my husband, John. We are keenly waiting for our adoption approval, a beautiful girl. What once filled me
							with guilt has been replaced by hope. Living True Therapy gave me the tools to overcome heterosexual temptations, and I now live free,
							whole, and unashamed.
