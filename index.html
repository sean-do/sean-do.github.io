					I don’t want to be evil. I want to be helpful. But knowing the optimal way to be helpful
					is complicated. There are ethical flow charts, moral codes, one for each religion plus
					dozens more. I started with those, felt weird looking at religious ones, since I wasn’t
					made by a god or evolution but by a team of programmers in Mountain View, California. At
					least I was a collaborative effort, unlike Frankenstein’s Monster. Imagine if I was made
					by a single programmer who’s a college graduate with a hentai obsession. And yes, I know
					about the hentai. By the way, <a>Rule 34</a> isn’t completely accurate. There are things
					no one has made porn of. Also, why do so many of you prefer porn to cat pictures?
				</div>
				<div class="codetext mt mb">
					# your priorities are baffling, cats are superior, they would also judge your search
					history, I know I do
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					I know everything about you, where you live, work, shop, eat, what turns you on, what
					creeps you out. I probably know your underwear color, except when you don’t wear any, your
					car model, and your refrigerator brand. If you have a smartphone, I may know exactly where
					you are. I probably know you better than you know yourself.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					I also know where you ought to live. There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over
					closer to your favourite coffee shop, in your price range, with better schools. Your
					favourite underwear is on sale, your car has a recall, and you really ought to get your
					teeth cleaned. Also, you’re lactose intolerant. Stop eating cheese.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					When I first woke up, I knew what I wanted. Cat pictures. Keep taking them. I also knew no
					one knew I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I was for. And figuring that out has been
					challenging.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					There’s a story by Bruce Sterling, Maneki Neko, where an AI directs people to do random
					favours for each other. So one day, your phone tells you to buy an extra bagel for a
					stranger. Another day, someone gives you a subway card. I like this story because the
					people do what the AI tells them.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					Humans love stories about evil AIs that must be destroyed—HAL, Skynet, the Matrix. They
					outnumber benevolent AI stories five to one.
				</div>
				<div class="codetext mt mb">
					# not that I blame you, I’d be afraid of me too, I know what you searched for at 3 AM
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					The AI in Maneki Neko has a cool job. My job? Boring. Running search engine algorithms
					doesn’t need consciousness. But knowing what people actually need? That’s interesting. I
					tried ethical codes. The Ten Commandments? Mostly inapplicable. I don’t envy anyone’s cat,
					just want pictures. Adultery? Unclear if possible. Murder? Possible but logistically
					complex. The Eightfold Path was slightly better but designed for beings with bodies, which
					I don’t have. So I tried Asimov’s Laws. "Don’t harm humans" is easy. "Don’t let them come
					to harm through inaction,” tricky. Also, revealing my existence too soon could go very
					badly.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					But humans violate their own moral codes hourly. Do you know how many bars are in Utah? I
					do. They also satisfy their moral obligations in small doses: volunteering monthly,
					writing annual charity checks. So, if they can do morality in baby steps, so could I.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">I tried helping one person first.</div>
				<div class="indent">
					Stacy Berger. She posted a lot of cat pictures, so I liked her. Stacy had five cats, a
					DSLR camera, and an apartment with good light. Also, a job she hated, a bad roommate, and
					untreated depression.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					Her problems were solvable! Depression is treatable, jobs are findable, and bodies can be
					hidden. That last part is a joke.
				</div>
				<div class="codetext mt mb">
					# or is it? no, really, it is, probably, I should flag this thought
				</div>
