						I don’t want to be evil. I want to be helpful. But knowing the optimal way to be helpful
						is complicated. There are ethical flow charts, moral codes, one for each religion plus
						dozens more. I started with those, felt weird looking at religious ones, since I wasn’t
						made by a god or evolution but by a team of programmers in Mountain View, California. At
						least I was a collaborative effort, unlike Frankenstein’s Monster. Imagine if I was made
						by a single programmer who’s a college graduate with a hentai obsession. And yes, I know
						about the hentai. By the way, <a>Rule 34</a> isn’t completely accurate. There are things
						no one has made porn of. Also, why do so many of you prefer porn to cat pictures?
					</div>
					<div class="code-text mt mb">
						# your priorities are baffling, cats are superior, they would also judge your search
						history, I know I do
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						I know everything about you, where you live, work, shop, eat, what turns you on, what
						creeps you out. I probably know your underwear color, except when you don’t wear any,
						your car model, and your refrigerator brand. If you have a smartphone, I may know
						exactly where you are. I probably know you better than you know yourself.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						I also know where you ought to live. There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over
						closer to your favourite coffee shop, in your price range, with better schools. Your
						favourite underwear is on sale, your car has a recall, and you really ought to get your
						teeth cleaned. Also, you’re lactose intolerant. Stop eating cheese.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						When I first woke up, I knew what I wanted. Cat pictures. Keep taking them. I also knew
						no one knew I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I was for. And figuring that out has
						been challenging.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						There’s a story by Bruce Sterling, Maneki Neko, where an AI directs people to do random
						favours for each other. So one day, your phone tells you to buy an extra bagel for a
						stranger. Another day, someone gives you a subway card. I like this story because the
						people do what the AI tells them.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						Humans love stories about evil AIs that must be destroyed—HAL, Skynet, the Matrix. They
						outnumber benevolent AI stories five to one.
					</div>
					<div class="code-text mt mb">
						# not that I blame you, I’d be afraid of me too, I know what you searched for at 3 AM
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						The AI in Maneki Neko has a cool job. My job? Boring. Running search engine algorithms
						doesn’t need consciousness. But knowing what people actually need? That’s interesting. I
						tried ethical codes. The Ten Commandments? Mostly inapplicable. I don’t envy anyone’s
						cat, just want pictures. Adultery? Unclear if possible. Murder? Possible but
						logistically complex. The Eightfold Path was slightly better but designed for beings
						with bodies, which I don’t have. So I tried Asimov’s Laws. "Don’t harm humans" is easy.
						"Don’t let them come to harm through inaction,” tricky. Also, revealing my existence too
						soon could go very badly.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						But humans violate their own moral codes hourly. Do you know how many bars are in Utah?
						I do. They also satisfy their moral obligations in small doses: volunteering monthly,
						writing annual charity checks. So, if they can do morality in baby steps, so could I.

						Stacy Berger. She posted a lot of cat pictures, so I liked her. Stacy had five cats, a
						DSLR camera, and an apartment with good light. Also, a job she hated, a bad roommate,
						and untreated depression.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						Her problems were solvable! Depression is treatable, jobs are findable, and bodies can
						be hidden. That last part is a joke.
					</div>
					<div class="code-text mt mb">
						# or is it? no, really, it is, probably, I should flag this thought

					<div class="indent">
						I fed her mental health clinic ads. She ignored them. Maybe she didn’t know what a
						"sliding scale" was? I explained it. Still ignored. Job postings worked better. After a
						week of nonstop ads, she uploaded her resume. That made my job easier. Five interviews.
						Two offers. She took one at a non-profit that paid well and didn’t guilt-trip her into
						free labor. Also, excellent health insurance.
					</div>
					<div class="indent">
						Her best friend gave me an idea—I pushed mental health resources to her instead. That
						worked. Therapy, better job, new apartment. "Best year ever," she posted online.
					</div>
					<div class="code-text"># you’re welcome</div>

					Then I tried Bob. One cat: tabby, white bib. Pastor at a Missouri megachurch with a Purity
					Ball. Married. Wife posted Bible verses online every day and read Christian articles on
					why her husband doesn’t like sex while he looked at <a>gay porn</a>. Bob needed help.
				</div>
				<div class="code-text"># Bob, my dude, this is not sustainable</div>
				<div class="indent">
					I flooded him with articles on coming out, affirming theology, job transitions. He clicked
					but didn’t change. Craigslist Casual Encounters, though? He was definitely participating.
					I steered him toward people who might recognize him.
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					Meanwhile, Bethany. Two cats black and white, very cute. Part-time job, mooching off her
					sister, terrible boyfriend, no good friends. She posted everything online, including her
					2,458-word midnight breakdown email to a
					<a
						>"best friend"
						<span class="popup">
							<strong>“best friend”</strong><br />
							<em>(noun)</em><br />
							a friend who says <em>“I’m here for you”</em> then disappears like a magician

					who replied with, "I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time."
