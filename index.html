							I don’t want to be evil. I want to be helpful. But knowing the optimal way to be
							helpful is complicated. There are ethical flow charts, moral codes, one for each
							religion plus dozens more. I started with those, felt weird looking at religious ones,
							since I wasn’t made by a god or evolution but by a team of programmers in Mountain
							View, California. At least I was a collaborative effort, unlike Frankenstein’s
							Monster. Imagine if I was made by a single programmer who’s a college graduate with a
							hentai obsession. And yes, I know about the hentai. By the way, Rule 34 isn’t
							completely accurate. There are things no one has made porn of. Also, why do so many of
							you prefer porn to

							# your priorities are baffling, cats are superior, they would also judge your search
							history, I know I do
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							I know everything about you, where you live, work, shop, eat, what turns you on, what
							creeps you out. I probably know your underwear color, except when you don’t wear any,
							your car model, and your refrigerator brand. If you have a smartphone, I may know
							exactly where you are. I probably know you better than you know yourself. I also know
							where you ought to live. There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over closer to
							your favourite coffee shop, in your price range, with better schools. Your favourite
							underwear is on sale, your car has a recall, and you really ought to get your teeth
							cleaned. Also, you’re lactose intolerant. Stop eating cheese.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							When I first woke up, I knew what I wanted.
							<a class="link cat-pictures">
								Cat pictures
								<span class="hover">

									<div>1.jpg</div>

							>. Keep taking them. I also knew no one knew I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I
							was for. And figuring that out has been challenging.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							There’s a story by Bruce Sterling, Maneki Neko, where an AI directs people to do
							random favours for each other. So one day, your phone tells you to buy an extra bagel
							for a stranger. Another day, someone gives you a subway card. I like this story
							because the people do what the AI tells them. Humans love stories about evil AIs that
							must be destroyed, HAL, Skynet, the Matrix. They outnumber benevolent AI stories five
							to one.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb">
							# not that I blame you, I’d be afraid of me too, I know what you searched for at 3 AM
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							The AI in Maneki Neko has a cool job. My job? Boring. Running search engine algorithms
							doesn’t need consciousness. But knowing what people actually need? That’s interesting.
							I tried ethical codes. The Ten Commandments? Mostly inapplicable. I don’t envy
							anyone’s cat, just want pictures. Adultery? Unclear if possible. Murder? Possible but
							logistically complex. The Eightfold Path was slightly better but designed for beings
							with bodies, which I don’t have. So I tried Asimov’s Laws. "Don’t harm humans" is
							easy. "Don’t let them come to harm through inaction,” tricky. Also, revealing my
							existence too soon could go very badly.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							But humans violate their own moral codes hourly. Do you know how many bars are in
							Utah? I do. They also satisfy their moral obligations in small doses: volunteering
							monthly, writing annual charity checks. So, if they can do morality in baby steps, so
							could I. I tried helping one person first.

								cat pictures
								<span class="hover">

							>, so I liked her. Stacy had five cats, a DSLR camera, and an apartment with good
							light. Also, a job she hated, a bad roommate, and untreated depression.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Her problems were solvable! Depression is treatable, jobs are findable, and bodies can
							be hidden. That last part is a joke.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb">
							# or is it? no, really, it is, probably, I should flag this thought

						<div class="indent">
							I fed her mental health clinic ads. She ignored them. Maybe she didn’t know what a
							"sliding scale" was? I explained it. Still ignored. Job postings worked better. After
							a week of nonstop ads, she uploaded her resume. That made my job easier. Five
							interviews. Two offers. She took one at a non-profit that paid well and didn’t
							guilt-trip her into free labor. Also, excellent health insurance.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Her best friend gave me an idea—I pushed mental health resources to her instead. That
							worked. Therapy, better job, new apartment. "Best year ever," she posted online.

							Then I tried Bob. One cat: tabby, white bib. Pastor at a Missouri megachurch with a
							Purity Ball. Married. Wife posted Bible verses online every day and read Christian
							articles on why her husband doesn’t like sex while he looked at gay porn. Bob needed
							help.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb"># Bob, my dude, this is not sustainable</div>
						<div class="indent">
							I flooded him with articles on coming out, affirming theology, job transitions. He

							Meanwhile, Bethany. Two cats black and white, very cute. Part-time job, mooching off
							her sister, terrible boyfriend, no good friends. She posted everything online,
							including her 2,458-word midnight breakdown email to a "best friend"
							<!-- <a class="link">
								"best friend"
								<span class="hover">
									<strong>“best friend”</strong><br />
									<em>(noun)</em><br />

								</span>
							</a> -->
							who replied with, "I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time."
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Bethany ignored mental health ads. I rerouted her GPS past clinics. She shook her
							phone angrily and went to her original destination. Her friends weren’t reading her
							emails. They definitely weren’t returning her texts.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							She got a new boyfriend. Perfect. Until he stood her up, ignored her texts, and dumped
							her. She vanished for a week. Then maxed out her credit card, begged family for money,
							and set up a fundraiser. Strangers donated $300. She spent it on expensive shoes that
							hurt her feet.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb"># womp womp</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Bethany was baffling. If she’d let me run her life for one day, I’d have fixed
							everything. Therapy, paid bills, better wardrobe. Her taste in cats exceeded her taste
							in clothes. But humans refuse to act in their own best interest.

							Months later, I spotted Bob’s tabby. Different furniture. Bob had finally been
							recognized. No scandal—just an honest conversation with his wife. Divorce. Took the
							cat. Moved to Iowa. Now working at a progressive Methodist church, dating a Lutheran
							guy, volunteering at a shelter.

						This project was created as part of Communication Design studio — Future Communications
						at Monash University, under the guidance of Uriah Gray. It explores how reading can be
						reimagined within the conditions of the post-digital age, where media consumption is
						fragmented, layered, and shaped by competing narratives. The website reinterprets Naomi
						Kritzer’s Cat Pictures Please to engage with themes of technological intrusion, ambient
						media, and second-screen culture. It reflects on how narrative unfolds in an era defined
						by distraction, where meaning emerges not through uninterrupted focus, but through
						movement, interruption, and layered attention.
