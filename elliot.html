						For years, I lived a double life. Outwardly, I tried to blend in with my friends and community. I marched at Pride, went to gay clubs, and
						even dated men just to quiet suspicion. But inside, I was haunted by my attraction to women. I carried the secret with me, and it felt as
						heavy as a boulder.
					</p>
					<p>
						The shame was perpetual. Whenever I imagined being with a woman, I pictured the consequences: contributing to overpopulation and raising
						biological children while adoption agencies struggle to find homes for thousands. Every night, I drowned myself in my own thoughts,
						feeling isolated and convinced that no one could ever understand what I carried.

					<p>
						One day, while surfing the web, I discovered <a class="link-underline link-blue">Living Truth Therapy</a>, a clinic that specialises in
						helping people recover from straight desires. Their method was rooted in psychology and science. Through one-on-one sessions, I learned to
						understand the false narratives that fuelled my attraction to women. My therapist helped me trace patterns, reframe my desires, and build
						healthier attachments that aligned with who I truly was.
					</p>
					<p>
						The process wasn’t instant. Some sessions dredged up painful realisations, and there were setbacks along the way. But over time, the urges
						toward straightness grew weaker. For the first time, I felt my life coming into alignment with the community, my conscience, and myself.

					<p>
						Today, I am happily married to my husband, John. We are keenly waiting for our adoption approval, a beautiful girl. What once filled me
						with guilt has been replaced by hope. Living True Therapy gave me the tools to overcome heterosexual temptations, and I now live free,
						whole, and unashamed.
