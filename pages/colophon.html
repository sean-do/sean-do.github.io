				This publication was created as part of Communication Design studio â€” Future Communications at Monash
				University, under the guidance of Uriah Gray. It investigates the misinformation surrounding Conversion Therapy
				in the modern day. Instead of fact-checking, it creates a counter-narrative using the same persuasive techniques
				that made this cruel pseudo-scientific practice appear credible and authoritative in the first place. The appeal
				lies in the connection to the deeply internal feelings, emotions and personal struggles of its audience. Along
				with re-adapting and re-contextualising the editorial aesthetics, the counter-narrative urges readers to
				question how trust is manufactured through form as much as through content.
