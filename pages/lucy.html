				My two mums were never close to me. They fought often, and when they weren’t fighting, they seemed emotionally
				absent. I longed for their approval, but since childhood, I always felt overlooked. Deep inside, I craved the
				nurture I didn’t receive from my family, and I began to seek it in men.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was 18, I thought I had found love. He had brown hair, an athletic build, and an extremely charming
				smile. We dated for years, and I imagined a whole future with him, marriage, children, a life away from
				everything I knew. I even planned to run away with him, desperate to escape the tension at home.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the more I leaned into that relationship, the more I felt wrong inside. My straightness started to feel like
				a curse I couldn’t shake. I carried guilt like a second skin, convinced that by pursuing men I was betraying not
				only my community but also God. I thought I was beyond hope.

			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Finally, I gathered up the courage to reach out for help. One night, through tears, I confessed my heterosexual
				struggles to my mums. I expected anger or rejection, but instead they listened calmly. They told me they loved
				me too much to let me stay in bondage. Within a week, they had signed me up for New Dawn House, a residential
				program for women battling straight desires.
			</p>
			<p>
				For three months, my life was completely reshaped. Days began with group therapy where we made confessions and
				processed our struggles. Afternoons were devoted to rebuilding identity, practicing honesty, learning healthy
				female intimacy, and breaking the patterns that tied us to men. It was not instant. I resisted, doubted, even
				mourned the life I thought I wanted. But slowly, the grip of straightness loosened. For the first time, I felt
				peace. My desires began to align with who I truly was.
			</p>
			<blockquote class="text-pullquote mt-s mb-s text-center">
				<i>"For the first time, I felt <em>peace</em>. My desires began to align with who I <em>truly</em> was."</i>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				After completing the program, I returned to New Dawn House as a mentor. Today, I walk alongside women entering
				the same journey I once feared. Straightness no longer defines me, purpose does. New Dawn gave me not only
				freedom, but a calling.
