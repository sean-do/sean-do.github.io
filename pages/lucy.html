						My two mums were never close to me. They fought often, and when they weren’t fighting, they seemed
						emotionally absent. I longed for their approval, but since childhood, I always felt overlooked. Deep inside,
						I craved the nurture I didn’t receive from my family, and I began to seek it in men.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I was 18, I thought I had found love. He had brown hair, an athletic build, and an extremely charming
						smile. We dated for years, and I imagined a whole future with him, marriage, children, a life away from
						everything I knew. I even planned to run away with him, desperate to escape the tension at home.
					</p>
					<p>
						But the more I leaned into that relationship, the more I felt wrong inside. My straightness started to feel
						like a curse I couldn’t shake. I carried guilt like a second skin, convinced that by pursuing men I was
						betraying not only my community but also God. I thought I was beyond hope.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, I gathered up the courage to reach out for help. One night, through tears, I confessed my
						heterosexual struggles to my mums. I expected anger or rejection, but instead they listened calmly. They
						told me they loved me too much to let me stay in bondage. Within a week, they had signed me up for New Dawn
						House, a residential program for women battling straight desires.
					</p>
					<p>
						For three months, my life was completely reshaped. Days began with group therapy where we made confessions
						and processed our struggles. Afternoons were devoted to rebuilding identity, practicing honesty, learning
						healthy female intimacy, and breaking the patterns that tied us to men.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was not instant. I resisted, doubted, even mourned the life I thought I wanted. But slowly, the grip of
						straightness loosened. For the first time, I felt peace. My desires began to align with who I truly was.
						After completing the program, I returned to New Dawn House as a mentor. Today, I walk alongside women
						entering the same journey I once feared. Straightness no longer defines me, purpose does. New Dawn gave me
						not only freedom, but a calling.
