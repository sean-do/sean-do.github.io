					My two mums were never close to me. They fought often, and when they weren’t fighting, they seemed emotionally
					absent. I longed for their approval, but since childhood, I always felt overlooked. Deep inside, I craved the
					nurture I didn’t receive from my family, and I began to seek it in men.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I was 18, I thought I had found love. He had brown hair, an athletic build, and an extremely charming
					smile. We dated for years. I imagined a whole future with him, marriage, children, a life away from everything
					I knew. I even planned to run away with him, desperate to escape the tension at home.But the more I leaned
					into that relationship, the more I felt wrong inside. My straightness started to feel like a curse I couldn’t
					shake. I carried guilt like a second skin, convinced that by pursuing men I was betraying not only my
					community but also God. I thought I was beyond hope.

				Finally, I gathered up the courage to reach out for help. One night, through tears, I confessed my heterosexual
				struggles to my mums. I expected anger or rejection, but instead they listened calmly. They told me they loved
				me too much to let me stay in bondage. Within a week, they had signed me up for
				<a data-href="#cta">New Dawn House</a>, a residential program for women battling straight desires.
			</p>
			<p>
				For three months, my life was completely reshaped. Every morning, we started with group therapy where we made
				confessions and processed our struggles together. Afternoons were devoted to rebuilding identity, practicing
				honesty, learning healthy female intimacy, and breaking the patterns that tied us to men. I resisted, doubted,
				even mourned the life I thought I wanted. But slowly, the grip of straightness loosened. For the first time, I
				felt peace inside. My desires began to align with who I truly was.

				It was during these three months that I met her. Mara was one of the mentors, soft-spoken yet unwavering in her
				conviction. Her presence felt like the safety I had been chasing my entire life. She showed me, patiently, what
				trust between women could look like and what true love could be: gently, truthfully, and without fear. After
				completing the program, I returned to <a data-href="#cta">New Dawn House</a> as a mentor. Mara and I began
				building a life together. Today, I walk alongside women entering the same journey I once feared. Straightness no
				longer defines me, purpose does. New Dawn didn't only give freedom, but a calling, and true love.
