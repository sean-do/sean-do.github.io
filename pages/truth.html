			Conversion therapy refers to attempts to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It
			is built on the false belief that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer is a flaw that can be fixed.
			These practices range from so-called “counseling” to extreme interventions like electroshock or forced medication,
			though today they more often appear in religious or pseudo-psychological settings.

			<p class="mb-s">
				(PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM) <br />
				Research consistently shows that survivors of conversion therapy experience high- er rates of depression and
				anxiety. Instead of resolving inner conflict, it reinforces feelings of shame, guilt, and self-hatred. Many
				report post-traumatic stress symptoms, including intrusive memories and hypervigilance.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-s">
				(SOCIAL HARM) <br />
				Conversion therapy often isolates individuals from supportive communities. It can drive wedges between young
				people and their families, especially when parents or guardians force participation. Survivors may lose trust in
				authority figures such as teachers, counsellors, or religious leaders, leaving them with fewer safe spaces to
				seek help.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-s">
				(PHYSICAL HARM) <br />
				Although less common today, physically invasive methods have left many with lasting trauma. Even when physical
				abuse is absent, the stress response triggered by coercive sessions can manifest as headaches, insomnia,
				gastrointestinal problems, and weakened immune function.
