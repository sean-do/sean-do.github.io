					Conversion therapy refers to attempts to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
					It is built on the false belief that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer is a flaw that can be
					fixed. These practices range from so-called “counseling” to extreme interventions like electroshock or forced
					medication, though today they more often appear in religious or pseudo-psychological settings.

						(PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM) <br />
						Research consistently shows that survivors of conversion therapy experience high- er rates of depression and
						anxiety. Instead of resolving inner conflict, it reinforces feelings of shame, guilt, and self-hatred. Many
						report post-traumatic stress symptoms, including intrusive memories and hypervigilance.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-s">
						(SOCIAL HARM) <br />
						Conversion therapy often isolates individuals from supportive communities. It can drive wedges between young
						people and their families, especially when parents or guardians force participation. Survivors may lose
						trust in authority figures such as teachers, counsellors, or religious leaders, leaving them with fewer safe
						spaces to seek help.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-s">
						(PHYSICAL HARM) <br />
						Although less common today, physically invasive methods have left many with lasting trauma. Even when
						physical abuse is absent, the stress response triggered by coercive sessions can manifest as headaches,
						insomnia, gastrointestinal problems, and weakened immune function.

					<p class="text-caption-serif mt-xxs">
						This publication was created as part of Communication Design studio — Future Communications at Monash
						University, under the guidance of Uriah Gray. It investigates the misinformation surrounding Conversion
						Therapy in the modern day. Instead of fact-checking, it creates a counter-narrative using the same
						persuasive techniques that made this cruel pseudo-scientific practice appear credible and authoritative in
						the first place. The appeal lies in the connection to the deeply internal feelings, emotions and personal
						struggles of its audience. Along with re-adapting and re-contextualising the editorial aesthetics, the
						counter-narrative urges readers to question how trust is manufactured through form as much as through
						content.
