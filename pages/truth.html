			Conversion Therapy refers to attempts to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. It
			is built on the false belief that being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer is a flaw that can be fixed.
			These practices range from so-called <i>“counseling”</i> to extreme interventions like electroshock or forced
			medication, though today they more often appear in religious or pseudo-psychological settings.

			<h3>(PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM)</h3>
			<p>
				A substantial body of research has documented profound psychological distress among individuals subjected to
				conversion therapy. Survivors consistently report higher incidences of depression, anxiety, and suicidal
				thoughts compared to LGBTQ+ individuals who have not undergone such practices.<a
					data-href="#fn1"
					class="citation"
					>1</a
				>
				Instead of resolving internal conflicts, conversion therapy often intensifies feelings of shame, guilt, and
				self-hatred by invalidating core aspects of the individual’s identity. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress
				disorder (PTSD) are also prevalently demonstrated, including intrusive memories of therapy sessions, emotional
				numbing, and hypervigilance.<a class="citation">2</a> The American Psychiatric Association<a class="citation"
					>3</a
				>
				and World Health Organization<a class="citation">4</a>
				strongly condemn conversion therapy due to its documented psychological harms and lack of efficacy.
			</p>
			<h3>(SOCIAL HARM)</h3>
			<p>
				Conversion therapy often isolates individuals from the affirming and supportive communities that they need, and
				instead place its victims in an environment of mistrust and stigma. Young people that are coerced into
				participation by their family members or guardians are particularly vulnerable, as they lack agency over their
				own decisions. These situations can often deepen familial conflict and aggravate the sense of alienation.<a
					class="citation"
					>5</a
				>
				Survivors can also lose faith in authority figures, including counsellors, religious leaders, and educators, who
				may have endorsed or facilitated the therapy, thereby further reducing access to supportive social and mental
				health resources. This isolation further compounds risks related to loneliness, social withdrawal, and
				diminished resilience.<a class="citation">6</a>
			</p>
			<h3>(PHYSICAL HARM)</h3>
			<p>
				Although the most extreme physical abuses like electroshock are rarer today, conversion therapy still induces
				health consequences through stress-related mechanisms. The trauma of coercive sessions can manifest physically
				as chronic headaches, insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances, and lowered immune function.<a class="citation"
					>7</a
				>
				In some cases, survivors report lasting bodily harm from historical physical abuse during therapy. The
				physiological burden of sustained psychological trauma underscores the extensive harm conversion therapy
				inflicts beyond mental health, affecting overall life quality and physical well-being.
