					For years, I lived a double life. Outwardly, I tried to blend in with my friends and community. I marched at
					Pride, went to gay clubs, and even dated men just to quiet suspicion. But inside, I was haunted by my
					attraction to women. I carried the secret with me, and it felt as heavy as a boulder.
				</p>
				<p>
					The shame was perpetual. Whenever I imagined being with a woman, I pictured the consequences: contributing to
					overpopulation and raising biological children while adoption agencies struggle to find homes for thousands.
					Every night, I drowned myself in my own thoughts, feeling isolated and convinced that no one could ever
					understand what I carried.

				One day, while surfing the web, I discovered <a href="#cta">Living Truth Therapy</a>, a clinic that specialises
				in helping people recover from straight desires. Their method was rooted in psychology and science. Through
				one-on-one sessions, I learned to understand the false narratives that fuelled my attraction to women. My
				therapist helped me trace patterns, reframe my desires, and build healthier attachments that aligned with who I
				truly was.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process wasn’t instant. Some sessions dredged up painful realisations, and there were setbacks along the
				way. But over time, the urges toward straightness grew weaker. For the first time, I felt my life coming into
				alignment with the community, my conscience, and myself.

			<p>
				Today, I am happily married to my husband, John. We are keenly waiting for our adoption approval, a beautiful
				girl. What once filled me with guilt has been replaced by hope. <a href="#cta">Living Truth Therapy</a> gave me
				the tools to overcome heterosexual temptations, and I now live free, whole, and unashamed.
