			Ezekayle’s story is one of divine transformation and deliverance. Once burdened by the temptation of heterosexual
			desire, she found freedom through faith and the fierce love of House of Queens Ministries. Ezekayle is the living
			proof that no sin is too strong for God’s forgiveness.

				<p>
					From my earliest memory, I was drawn to heterosexuality. I grew up in church, surrounded by teaching that God
					had created us to live authentically, to shine in the fullness of who we were. While everyone around me was
					celebrating drag idols, getting excited about RuPaul’s Drag Race, and practicing lip-syncs for talent shows, I
					secretly longed for a quiet life with a woman, hidden away from the stage. Straight temptations whispered that
					I could be safe and satisfied in a relationship with a woman, but deep down I knew it wasn’t God’s plan for my
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					By the end of college, the struggle consumed me. I craved the warmth of a girl’s affection, the comfort of her
					smile, the closeness I dared not confess. I prayed night after night, begging God to take away the feelings,
					to save me from the sinful thoughts. I played my part, performing in drag like everyone else, but each wig,
					each dress, each night under the lights felt like a disguise, a costume concealing my brokenness.

				But God eventually decided to intervene when I was 24. A friend invited me to
				<a data-href="#cta">House of Queens Ministries</a>, a Christian group committed to helping those plagued by
				straight desires. For the first time, I heard the truth out loud: straightness is not who we are. We are called
				to freedom in Christ, to authenticity, community, and the artistry of drag.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through prayer meetings, mentoring by drag mothers of faith, and nights spent on my knees before God, I
				confessed my sins and laid down my heterosexual temptations at the cross. The more I prayed, the more I could
				sense the presence of God. Slowly, He embraced me and put a permanent band-aid on the wounds that drove me
				toward straightness.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<i>"The more I prayed, the more I could sense the presence of <em>God</em>."</i>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Today, I am free, no longer bound by straight sin. I live as the drag queen God intended. If you, too, are
				trapped by heterosexual desires, know that there is hope.
				<a data-href="#cta">House of Queens Ministries</a> exists to walk with you toward wholeness. God forgave me,
				healed me, and crowned me with His glory. He will do the same for you.
